What is the difference between state and props?
  Props are used to pass data and state is used for managing data.
  
What is ReactDOM? What is the difference between ReactDOM and React?
  ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. The react package holds the react source for components, state, props and all the code that is react.
  The ReactDOM is usually used for a single thing: mounting your app to the index.html file with ReactDOM.render().
  
What is React.createClass?
  createClass allows you to generate component "classes". Under the hood, your component class is using a bespoke class system implemented by React.

Which (if there is) node library method could you use to solve the algorithm problem you solved last night in your pre-homework?

Which new JavaScript / browser features are you most excited about and why?
  The Logical Assignment Operator combines logical operations like, (??, &&, or ||) with an assignment (e.g. =).
  Some examples: a || = b returns a if a is truthy or b if a is falsy.
